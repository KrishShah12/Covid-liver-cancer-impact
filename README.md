# Assessing the impact of COVID-19 on Liver Cancer patients

The rise in primary liver cancers, notably hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) due to alcohol-related liver disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, has been a concerning trend in Northern England. The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic further exacerbated challenges within healthcare systems, particularly affecting liver cancer patients. This study aims to assess the impact of the pandemic on survival rates among newly diagnosed liver cancer patients in the region. Utilizing survival analysis techniques, we compared data from before and during the pandemic to identify key factors influencing patient prognosis. Our findings shed light on the dynamic interplay between the pandemic and liver cancer outcomes, providing valuable insights for developing effective clinical strategies and patient management approaches amidst the COVID-19 era. By understanding these impacts, healthcare professionals can better tailor care for liver cancer patients and navigate the complexities of managing this disease in the context of a global health crisis.
